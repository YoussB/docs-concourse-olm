You can find some more information on using the Concourse BOSH release  in the
<a href="https://github.com/concourse/concourse-bosh-deployment">Concourse BOSH Deployment</a> repository.
This page includes sample manifest files, references to prerequisite BOSH knowledge, IaaS-specific configurations, and more.

    <b>Deploying Concourse with an External PostgresDB:</b>
    <div>
      Concourse v3.6.0+ no longer manages an internal
      Postgres database with the BOSH release. An operator will need to instruct
      Concourse to connect to an externally managed Postgres database or a BOSH
      managed Cloud Foundry Postgres release (available on <a href="http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release">bosh.io</a>).
      The specific configuration changes that you will need to make can be made in the
      properties of the ATC job <a href="https://bosh.io/jobs/atc?source=github.com/concourse/concourse#p=postgresql">here</a>.

    <b>Load Balancing Multiple ATCs</b>
    <div>
      If you anticipate a heavy load on your Concourse installation, you may want
      to consider installing a Load Balancer with multiple ATCs.
