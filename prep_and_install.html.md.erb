    <b>Deploying Concourse with an External PostgresDB:</b>
    <div>
      The default configuration of Concourse will install and connect to an internally
      managed Postgres database. An operator may wish to instruct Concourse to connect
      to an externally managed Postgres database instead.
      The specific configuration changes that you will need to make can be made in the
      properties of the ATC job <a href="https://bosh.io/jobs/atc?source=github.com/concourse/concourse&version=3.3.2#p=postgresql">here</a>.
    </div>

  <li>
    <b>Load Balancing Multiple ATCs</b>
    <div>
      If you anticipate a heavy load on your Concourse installation, you may want
      to consider installing a Load Balancer with multiple ATCs.
