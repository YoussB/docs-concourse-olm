title: Configuring Team Authentication
owner: Concourse
---

This topic describes how to configue your team's authentication using authentication providers and teams.

Continuous Integration servers often contain a considerable number of secrets to let them access source code and deploy applications.
It is important that those secrets remain well guarded.
Concourse provides options for both authentication and authorization to give you control over who can access your server and how much they can see.

Any number of the following providers can be enabled at any one time.
Users are given a choice when logging in as to which one they want to use.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
If you access your Concourse server over the public internet, then you should
consider using TLS to secure your connection to the web node.
</p>

Configuring team authentication in Concourse is done in two parts:

1. Configure the allowed authentication providers in the deployment manifest.
2. Add users and groups to Concourse teams using `fly set-team`.


## <a id="configuring"></a> Configure Authentication Providers
Concourse can be configured to use local users, GitHub, generic LDAP, Cloud Foundry, oAuth,
and OIDC as authentication providers.
You must specify the allowed authentication providers before Concourse is deployed.

A Concourse operator needs to provide the following information in their Concourse deployment manifest:

* A list of allowed local users.
* Configurations against third-party authentication providers (GitHub, generic LDAP, Cloud Foundry, oAuth, and OIDC).
* Users who should be members of the default `main` team (either local users or users/groups from external authentication providers).

### <a id="local-users"></a> Local Users
Local users must be declared in the `add_local_users` of the `atc` job in the deployment manifest.
Passwords can be supplied in plaintext or as a bcrypted string (minimum 10 rounds)

Example:
<pre class="code">
- user1:password1
- user2:$2y$10$W9542XKXzG5aedX09AlSg.nr0IwejlWosCWXzRKl1eOFzdpgOrGcG
</pre>

<p class="note"> <code>user1</code> and <code>user2</code> do not yet have access to any teams - they must be granted access on a team-by-team basis (see <a href="authenticating.html#adding">Add Users and Groups to Teams</a>).</p>


### <a id="config-github"></a> GitHub Authentication
A Concourse server can authenticate against GitHub to take advantage of their permission model and other security improvements in their infrastructure.
To do this, you will need to:

1. Create a GitHub application.
2. Configure your deployment with the GitHub client details.


#### Create a GitHub Application
You can create an OAuth application on GitHub.
To do this, see [Register a new OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

The callback URL will be the external URL of your Concourse server with `/sky/issuer/callback` appended.
For example, Concourse's own CI server's callback URL would be `https://ci.concourse-ci.org/sky/issuer/callback`.

<p class="note"> The application must be created under an organization if you want to authorize users based on organization/team membership. If the application is created under a personal account, only individual users can be authorized.</p>


#### Configure the GitHub Client Details
GitHub will provide a Client ID and a Client Secret for the new application.
This information needs to be supplied in the `github_auth` `client_id` and `client_secret` fields.
For more information on these fields, see [github_auth](https://bosh.io/jobs/atc?source=github.com/concourse/concourse&version=4.0.0#p%3dgithub_auth).


### <a id="config-cf"></a> Cloud Foundry Authentication
Cloud Foundry Authentication (CF Auth) can be used for operators who wish to authenticate their users configured against their Cloud Foundry instance with the User Account and Authentication (UAA) server.

To do this, you will need to:

1. Create a UAA Client.
2. Configure your deployment with the Cloud Foundry client details.


#### Create the Client
A client must be created for Concourse in UAA.

The callback URL will be the external URL of your Concourse server with `/sky/issuer/callback` appended. For example, Concourse's own CI server's callback URL would be https://ci.concourse-ci.org/sky/issuer/callback.

The client should look something like this, under `uaa.clients`:

<pre class="code">
concourse:
  id: my-client-id
  secret: my-client-secret
  scope: openid,cloud_controller.read
  authorized-grant-types: "authorization_code,refresh_token"
  access-token-validity: 3600
  refresh-token-validity: 3600
  redirect-uri: https://concourse.example.com/sky/issuer/callback
</pre>


#### Configure the client
You will be given a Client ID and a Client Secret for your new application.
These will then be passed in the `client_id` and `client-secret` fields on the `atc` job.
For more information on these fields, see [client_id](https://bosh.io/jobs/atc?source=github.com/concourse/concourse&version=4.0.0#p%3dcf_auth.client_id).

You will also need to configure your base API URL for CF in the `api_url` field.
To do this, see [api_url](https://bosh.io/jobs/atc?source=github.com/concourse/concourse&version=4.0.0#p%3dcf_auth.api_url).


### <a id="config-oidc"></a> OIDC Authentication

If your authentication provider adheres to the OIDC specification, then you should use this provider.
Unlike the oAuth provider, you do not need to provide `auth-url`, `token-url` and `userinfo-url`.
Instead, you can provide an `issuer-url`, and the system will query the `.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint to discover all of the information it needs.

To add the OIDC authentication provider, you will need to:

1. Create the OIDC client.
2. Configure the client.


#### Create the OIDC Client
First you need to create a client with your OIDC provider.

The callback URL will be the external URL of your Concourse server with `/sky/issuer/callback appended`.
For example, Concourse's own CI server's callback URL would be `https://ci.concourse-ci.org/sky/issuer/callback`.


#### Configure the client
Configuring generic OIDC will require you to fill in the `generic_oidc` fields in the `atc` job of the manifest.
For more information on these fields, see [generic_oidc](https://bosh.io/jobs/atc?source=github.com/concourse/concourse&version=4.0.0#p%3dgeneric_oidc).


### <a id="config-oauth"></a>  oAuth Authentication
If your authentication provider supports oAuth2 but doesn't adhere to the OIDC specification, then you should be using this provider.
This provider gives you slightly more control over the OIDC provider by letting operators specify the full set of authorization endpoints (`auth-url`, `token-url`).

To add the oAuth provider you will need to:

1. Create the OIDC client
2. Configure the client


#### Create the oAuth Client
You will first need to create a client with your oAuth provider.

The callback URL will be the external URL of your Concourse server with `/sky/issuer/callback appended`.
For example, Concourse's own CI server's callback URL would be `https://ci.concourse-ci.org/sky/issuer/callback`.


#### Configure the Client
Configuring the oAuth provider will require you to fill in the `generic_oauth` fields in the `atc` job of the manifest.
For more information on these fields, see [generic_oauth](https://bosh.io/jobs/atc?source=github.com/concourse/concourse&version=4.0.0#p%3dgeneric_oauth).


### <a id="config-main"></a> The Main team
By default, Concourse comes with a single team called `main`.
The `main` team is an admin team, meaning it can create and update other teams.
Currently there is no way to promote a team to become an admin team,
so `main` is a special case.

Concourse requires you to specify at least one user/group to be a member of the `main`
team on deployment.
The list of allowed users, groups, and orgs are managed through the `main_team` property in the ATC job.
For more information on this property, see [main_team](https://bosh.io/jobs/atc?source=github.com/concourse/concourse&version=4.0.0#p%3dmain_team).

An example of adding a local user to the main team can be found in the `add-local-users.yml` file in the [concourse-bosh-deployment](https://github.com/concourse/concourse-bosh-deployment/blob/master/cluster/operations/add-local-users.yml) repository.

The values set in the authentication flags take effect whenever the ATC starts up.
This is done so that you cannot get locked out, and you can have Concourse sanely configured as soon as it comes up.


## <a id="adding"></a>Add Users and Groups to Teams
After you deploy Concourse with the authentication providers configured,
you may specify allowed users and groups using the `fly set-team` command.
With this command, users and groups can be:

  * Added to new teams
  * Modified on existing teams

For more information on this command, see [fly set-team](https://concourse-ci.org/creating-and-updating-teams.html#fly-set-team).

<p class="note">
The exception to this is the <code>main</code> team. Members of the <code>main</code> team are configured as part of the initial deployment and cannot be changed after the deployment. For more information on the <code>main</code> team, see <a href="https://concourse-ci.org/main-team.html">The <code>main</code> team</a>.
</p>


### <a id="add-basic-auth"></a> Local Users
You can grant local users access to a team via the `--local-user` flag:

<ol>
<li>Open a terminal window.</li>
<li>Enter the following commands:<br/>
<pre class="code">
$  fly set-team -n YOUR_TEAM \
      --local-user USERNAME
</pre>
</li>
</ol>


### <a id="add-github"></a> GitHub Users, Teams and Orgs
Add GitHub users, teams, or organizations to a Concourse team.

* `--github-user=LOGIN` Authorize an individual user.
* `--github-org=ORG_NAME` Authorize an entire organization's members.
* `--github-team=ORG_NAME:TEAM_NAME` Authorize a team's members within an organization.

For example:
<pre class="code">
$ fly set-team -n my-team \
    --github-user my-github-login \
    --github-org my-org \
    --github-team my-other-org:my-team
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
  <code>:</code> is used as the separator when adding GitHub teams.
</p>


### <a id="add-cf"></a> CF Auth Users, Space and Orgs
Add users, space and org members from a CF deployment to a Concourse team.

* `--cf-user=USERNAME` Authorize an individual user.
* `--cf-org=ORG_NAME` Authorize an entire organization's members.
* `--cf-space=ORG_NAME:SPACE_NAME` Authorize the members of a space within an organization.

For example:

<pre class="code">
$ fly set-team -n my-team \
    --cf-user my-username \
    --cf-org my-org \
    --cf-space my-other-org:my-space
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
  <code>:</code> is used as the separator when adding members from a CF space.
</p>


### <a id="add-oauth"></a> oAuth Users and Groups
Configure users and groups from a generic oAuth provider.

You may only configure groups if the authentication provider exposes this information in either the token itself, or in the contents of the userinfo endpoint.
You can configure which claim points to the groups information by specifying the groups-key at startup.

* `--cf-user=USERNAME` Authorize an individual user.
* `--cf-org=ORG_NAME` Authorize an entire organization's members.
* `--cf-space=ORG_NAME:SPACE_NAME` Authorize the members of a space within an organization.

For example:

<pre class="code">
$ fly set-team -n my-team \
    --oauth-user my-username \
    --oauth-group my-group
</pre>


### <a id="add-oidc"></a> OIDC Users and Groups
Team members can configure users and groups from a generic OIDC provider.
This is very similar to the oAuth connector.
The main difference being that OIDC providers must adhere to the OIDC specification,
whereas generic oAuth providers can be a little more flexible.

You may only configure groups if the authentication provider exposes this information in the contents of the userinfo endpoint.
You can configure which claim points to the groups information by specifying the `groups-key` at startup.

* `--oidc-user=USERNAME` Authorize an individual user.
* `--oidc-group=GROUP_NAME` Authorize anyone from the group.

For example:

<pre class="code">
$ fly set-team -n my-team \
    --oidc-user my-username \
    --oidc-group my-group
</pre>

### <a id="team-config"></a> Team Configuration Details
Team members can view the authentication settings of the teams they belong to by using the `fly teams -d` command.
