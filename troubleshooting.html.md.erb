title: Monitoring and Troubleshooting Your Installation

This topic broadly outlines techniques for troubleshooting your Concourse OLM installation. 

## <a id="log-collection"></a> Concourse OLM Log Collection

Find the logs for a specific job in the VM on which that job was running. Those logs are stored at <code>/var/vcap/sys/log/<\CONCOURSE-JOB-NAME>/*.log.</code> 

## <a id="fly-commands"></a> Troubleshooting ~with Fly Commands

### <a id="environment"></a> Concourse OLM Environment Troubleshooting
<code>containers</code>: Lists active containers
This confirms which container or task got placed on which worker
<code>workers</code>: Lists registered workers
This helps you verify that the number of containers aren't exceeding maximum allowable number of containers on a worker.
<code>prune-worker</code>: Reaps a non-running worker
Stops Concourse OLM from tracking an out-of-commission worker.
<code>volumes</code>: Lists active volumes
Checks disk usage across workers.

### <a id="pipeline"></a> Pipeline Troubleshooting:
<code>pipelines</code>: Lists configured pipelines
<code>builds</code>: Shows build history
This is useful for getting build IDs of one-off tasks you've run using <code>execute</code>.
<code>validate-pipeline</code>: Validates a pipeline's configuration
Checks pipeline for validity without calling <code>set-pipeline</code>.
<code>check-resource</code>: Checks for new versions  
This is useful when developing a new resource.
<code>watch</code>: View logs of in-progress builds
<code>intercept</code>: Accesses a running or recent build's steps
<code>execute</code>: Submits Local Tasks
This is useful for spinning up a task quickly to test before putting it in a job.

<table>
  <th>Problem</th>
  <th>Error</th>
  <th>Solution</th>
  <th>Other information</th>
  <tr>
    <td>The worker is out of disk space</td>
    <td>An error displays about inability to create volume. It may say permissions are denied.</td>
    <td>Increase persistent disk for worker or increase number of worker VMs.</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Container Limit Reached</td>
    <td>Cannot create container: limit of 250 containers reached</td>
    <td>Check fly containers<br/>
    Increase number of worker VMs<br/>
    Decrease <code>gc_interval</code> if set to custom value (a large interval could mean that expired containers are kept around long enough that they build up)</td>
    <td>This error state is unlikely to appear.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Job Doesn't Start</td>
    <td>This error may present as the build getting stuck in Pending state</td>
    <td>Restart the ATC job.<br/>
    To restart the ATC, log in as a root user on Concourse OLM web VMs (the ones on which ATC job is located), then running <code>monit restart atc</code>.<br/>
    Alternatively, run <code>bosh restart web --force</code>, which will be slower than the previous option.</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Updating Concourse OLM in Concourse OLM Job fails</td>
    <td>When BOSH deploying a Concourse OLM update from a job running on that Concourse OLM instance fails, typically the job will error with "worker for container not found." This is expected behavior; the BOSH Director will recreate the worker VM.</td>
    <td>Run the job again.</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bosh Can't Finish Worker Upgrade While Tasks Running</td>
    <td>If you have a long running task, BOSH won't be able to finalize the upgrade by restarting the worker job until all of the work has stopped.</td>
    <td>Wait for the work to complete.<br/>
    If you need to accomplish this quickly, cancel running tasks and jobs.</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
