Monitoring concourse for metrics: http://concourse.ci/metrics.html

The logs for a specific job inside concourse release will be located in the vms on which that job was running at the location /var/vcap/sys/log/<concourse-job-name>/*.log. To enable syslog forwarding or to get logs for other components of concourse refer to: https://bosh.io/docs/job-logs.html.


Fly commands useful for troubleshooting:

* concourse (env) troubleshooting:
  containers: Listing active containers
   - check which container/task got placed on which worker
  workers: Listing registered workers
   - useful to verify that the number of containers aren't exceeding maximum allowable container on a worker.
  prune-worker: Reap a non-running worker
   - stop concourse from tracking an out of commission worker
  volumes: Listing active volumes
   - check disk usage across workers.

* pipeline troubleshooting:
  pipelines: Listing configured pipelines
  builds: Showing build history
   - useful for getting build ids of one-off tasks run using execute
  validate-pipeline: Validate a pipeline's configuration
   - check pipeline for validity without calling set-pipeline
  check-resource: Trigger discovery of new versions
   - useful when developing a new resource
  watch: View logs of in-progress builds
  intercept: Accessing a running or recent build's steps
   - poke around in a task container to see what's up
  execute: Submitting Local Tasks
   - spinning up a task quickly to test before putting it in a job


Common bosh Issues: https://bosh.io/docs/tips.html

Common concourse Issues:
* Worker Out of Disk Space
- Symptoms:
   - cannot create volume: permissions denied (approximate error wording)
 - Solution:
   - increase persistent disk for worker or increase number of worker vms
* Container Limit Reached (unlikely)
  - Symptoms:
    - cannot create container: limit of 250 containers reached
  - Solution:
    - check fly containers
    - increase number of worker vms
    - decrease gc_interval if set to custom value (a large interval could mean that expired containers are kept around long enough that they build up)
* Job doesnt get started (Build stuck in Pending state)
  - Solution:
    - restart atc job.
     -> This can be done either by loggin in as a root user on concourse web vms (the ones on which atc job is located.) Then running `monit restart atc`
     -> Or by running `bosh restart web --force`, which will be slower than previous option.
* Updating Concourse in Concourse Job errors out
  - Symptom
    - when bosh deploying a concourse update from a job running on that concourse typically the job will error with "worker for container not found." This is expected as the bosh director will recreate the worker vm
  - Solution:
    - run it again; it should be a no-op the second time after a successful update
    - or just live with an orange build; it was probably a successful redeploy
  - Gotcha:
    - this is only possible when running with a bosh director as the director is performing the update. If your concourse is deployed using bosh create-env you will need to perform the update elsewhere, typically from your workstation
* Bosh Can't Finish Worker Upgrade While Tasks Running
  - Symptom:
    - if you have a long running task bosh won't be able to finalize the upgrade by restarting the worker job until all of the worker's jobs (tasks?) have stopped
  - Solution:
    - just wait
    - try to avoid long running tasks
      - e.g.: pool-resource if misused
    - cancel running tasks/jobs
