Concourse Operations Lifecycle Management (OLM) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is a continuous integration tool that lets you build, scale, and monitor pipelines outside of your PCF deployment. Using Concourse OLM, you can set up production pipelines to deploy and manage your apps in real time.  

You can also read the documentation for the open source [Concourse project](http://concourse.ci/introduction.html), which powers Concourse OLM.

## <a id="backing-up"></a>Back Up and Restore

Backing up Concourse OLM databases is a best practice that helps protect pipelines, build history, and team information over time. You can also use backed up versions of databases to restore database states after unexpected problems, like database failure, corruption, or interference from malicious third parties. 

For more information, read <a href="./backing-up.html" class="subnav">Backing Up and Restoring a Concourse OLM Database</a>.

For more information, read <a href="./authenticating.html" class="subnav">Configuring Authentication for Concourse OLM</a>.

## <a id="encryption"></a>Database Encryption

Concourse OLM lets you encrypt sensitive information in the database. 

For more information, read <a href="./encryption.html" class="subnav">Encrypting Concourse OLM Databases</a>.

## <a id="creds"></a>Managing Credentials

Credential management works by replacing the credentials with [((parameters))](https://concourse.ci/fly-set-pipeline.html#parameters) in your pipeline or task config files. Credential management also allows for credentials to be rotated and managed from outside the pipeline or team, and prevents them from being revealed by [get-pipeline](https://concourse.ci/fly-get-pipeline.html).
