Concourse for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is a continuous integration and delivery tool that lets you build and monitor scalable pipelines seamlessly. This topic describes how to install Concourse and what you need to install it successfully.

## <a id="prereqs"></a> Prerequisites
<ul>
<li>A supported IaaS provider: AWS, Azure, GCP, or vSphere</li>
<li>A <a href="http://bosh.io/docs/init.html">BOSH Director</a>. Do not use the BOSH Director associated with an existing PCF deployment.</li>
<li><a href="http://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html#install">BOSH CLI v2</a></li>
<li>Concourse + Garden Run-C BOSH releases downloaded from Pivotal Network</li>
<li>The stemcell for your IaaS, for when you create your Concourse deployment manifest.
  To download an Ubuntu Xenial stemcell from Pivotal Network, see
  <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial/">Stemcells for PCF (Ubuntu Xenial)</a></li>
<li>PostgreSQL 9.5+. Concourse can be configured to connect to an external PostgreSQL database or a BOSH managed Cloud Foundry Postgres release (available on <a href="http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release">bosh.io</a>). <b>NOTE:</b> As of Concourse 3.6.0 the Concourse BOSH release no longer supplies an internal postgres. <em>You must</em> provide your own postgres database as of 3.6.0</li>
</ul>

## <a id="setup"></a> Setting Up and Installing Concourse
<ol>
 <li>Configure your IaaS environment by modifying your cloud config for BOSH deployment. </li>
 <li>Prepare the Concourse deployment manifest. You can write your own manifest or <a href="https://github.com/concourse/concourse-bosh-deployment/blob/master/cluster/concourse.yml">modify a template</a> with your unique configuration. You can read more about BOSH deployment configurations in the <code>concourse-bosh-deployment</code> repo for <a href="https://github.com/concourse/concourse-bosh-deployment/blob/master/cluster/README.md">cluster deployments</a><br/>
 <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You will also need to configure authentication. Follow the instructions in <a href="./authenticating.html">Authentication</a>.<br/>
Provide <code>tls_cert</code> and <code>tls_key</code> values in the manifest.</p></li>
<li>Prepare the <code>cloud-config.yml</code> file and upload it to your BOSH Director with <code>bosh update-cloud-config</code>.<br/>
<li>Deploy Concourse with <code>bosh deploy</code>.
    For more information,
    see the <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html">BOSH CLI documentation</a> for more information.
