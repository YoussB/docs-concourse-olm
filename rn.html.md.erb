## <a id="release-notes"></a> Release Notes for Concourse v3.6.0
<strong>Nov 9, 2017</strong>

###<a id="breaking-changes"></a> BREAKING CHANGES

####Postgres
Concourse 3.6.0 now **requires** you to install and manage an external
PostgreSQL database (v9.5+). We have enabled an upgrade path to the
<a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release">CloudFoundry Postgres BOSH release</a> for your convenience.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You <strong>do not</strong> need to follow these instructions if your Concourse deployment already connects to an external PostgreSQL database (v9.5+).</p>

Migration Instructions:

1. If you have not done so already, upgrade your Concourse to 3.5.0. Concourse 3.5.0
includes a change to the postgres job that moves its data to a new location where
the Cloud Foundry Postgres release will detect and upgrade from.

2. Upload the Cloud Foundry Postgres release to your BOSH Director. Pivotal
tested this upgrade path with version 20, currently available on
<a href="http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release?version=20">bosh.io</a>

3. Once the release is uploaded, add a reference to the job in your Concourse
 deployment manifest. You can do this by swapping out the `concourse/postgresql`
  job for `postgres/postgres`.

4. In the same Concourse deployment manifest, update the ATC properties to
explicilty configure the database name and role. These values will vary based on your
deployment preferences. You can refer to our <a href="https://github.com/concourse/concourse/commit/17be5f144a799e344c9d1bb56d9595ff164c96ef">
changes on the single-vm Concourse manifest</a> as a reference point.

5. Note that the Postgres DB upgrade **must not** be combined in the same deployment
operation as a stemcell update

####Garden runC
Concourse 3.6.0 now requires Garden runC 1.9.0. Make sure you download the appropriate
version of Garden runC and recreate your workers.

###<a id="features"></a>Features
* `fly validate-pipeline` will now validate the `config` field on embedded tasks.
As a part of this change we have removed support for configuring both `config`
and `file`, which has been depracated.
* Build logs now have timestamps. You can find more about it on the feature post <a href="https://medium.com/concourse-ci/build-page-improvements-64ebe663a7ec">here</a>
* Build page now supports keyboard shortcuts. You can find more about it on the feature post <a href="https://medium.com/concourse-ci/build-page-improvements-64ebe663a7ec">here</a>.
  There is a known issue where keyboard shortcuts are non-functional on Firefox browsers. This should be fixed in a subsequent release.

### <a id="bug-fixes"></a> Bug Fixes
* Fixed an issue with pipeline scheduling that would result in high database connection usage.
* Fixed an issue where clicking and dragging on the pipeline view would send you to the job details page.


## <a id="release-notes"></a> Release Notes for Concourse v3.5.0
<strong>Sep 25, 2017</strong>

### <a id="features"></a> Features

* Support for <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/credhub">CredHub</a> for external credential management
* BaggageClaim volume creation APIs are now asynchronous
* Parallelized garbage collection. This should make things more durable to a slow worker, and make it harder for containers and volumes to "pile up" when the ATC is out of service briefly (i.e. during a deploy)
* BaggageClaim's response header timeout is now configurable, which should help those with large images that they're using for privileged tasks.

####Fly CLI
* When using groups in pipelines, `fly` will now let you know when you forgot to assign a job to a group
* `fly` now prints a URL to your build page when you run `execute`
* The fly command for <a href="http://concourse.ci/fly-set-team.html">`set-team`</a> and <a href="http://concourse.ci/fly-destroy-team.html">`destroy-team`</a> now lets you supply the flag `--non-interactive`
* Jobs with a pending build now have a static halo to better represent its waiting state
* The `fly` CLI can now format a pipeline configuration into its 'canonical form' using the new <a href="http://concourse.ci/fly-format-pipeline.html">`format-pipeline`</a> command
* The <a href="http://concourse.ci/fly-abort-build.html">`abort-build`</a> command can now abort by build ID

####Resources
* The <a href="https://github.com/concourse/semver-resource">Semver resource</a> now supports Google Cloud Storage
* The <a href="https://github.com/concourse/bosh-deployment-resource">Bosh Deployment</a> resource now uses the latest BOSH CLI
* The <a href="https://github.com/concourse/semver-resource">Semver resource</a> now supports Server Side Encryption
* The <a href='https://github.com/concourse/git-resource'>Git resource</a> will now save the committer email to `.git/committer`

####Web UI
* The legend on the pipeline page will now auto-hide after 10 seconds.
* When switiching between pipelines, the UI will now fit the pipeline in view.
* You can also press 'F' center a pipeline in view.

### <a id="bug-fixes"></a> Bug Fixes
* Jobs and resources with a forward slash in their name no longer error out when loading their details.
* Fixed a leak with goroutines that happens from <a href="http://concourse.ci/fly-intercept.html">`fly intercept`</a>
* Check containers will no longer be brutally destroyed if they're used too close to their expiration time.
* Previously, if a resource or resource type was parameterized via a credential manager, its check containers and caches would be mistakenly garbage-collected. They will now be kept around.
* Fixed an issue where the pipeline view will reset after a state change on the pipeline.
* Added the appropriate headers to stop GitHub from caching badges
* Fixed an issue with the garbage collector that happens when deleting teams
* Files with the `setuid` and `setgid` permissions set on them will no longer have them removed. This used to be lost with the `chown` performed for namespacing the files. We'll now restore it after the `chown`.
* The flags for configuring GitLab oAuth are now present in <a href="http://concourse.ci/fly-set-team.html">`set-team`</a>
* Fixed an underflow in BaggageClaim's volume size detection
* The `unpack` parameter in <a href="https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource">S3 resource</a> will no longer load the entire archive into memory, so it can be used for larger archives


### <a id="known-issues"></a> Known Issues
* A migration introduced in `v3.3.0` would load all the builds into memory and then process them, causing a lot of issues when upgrading. We optimized this migration to migrate build plans in batches, rather than all at once.
